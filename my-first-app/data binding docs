databinding = communication

communication btw ts code of componenents(business logic) and template(html): which is what the user sees

output data from ts to html(template): one direction to html template
string interpolation ({{data}})
property binding ([property]="data)

html (template) react to (user) events : other direction to ts code
event binding((event)="expression")

combination of both: two-way-binding([(ngModel)]="data")- does both of the above directions' work


String interpolation:
can't write block expression such as if else but can use ternary operator 

has to get a string in the end

Property binding: 

string interpolation vs property binding:
when you want to output sth in your template, print some text to it, use string interpolation. 
if you want to change some property, be that of html element or directive or componenet, use property binding

don't mix the two

event binding:

two-way-binding:
FormsModule is required

combine property and event binding

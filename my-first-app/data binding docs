databinding = communication

communication btw ts code of componenents(business logic) and template(html): which is what the user sees

output data from ts to html(template): one direction to html template
string interpolation ({{data}})
property binding ([property]="data)

html (template) react to (user) events : other direction to ts code
event binding((event)="expression")

combination of both: two-way-binding([(ngModel)]="data")- does both of the above directions' work


String interpolation:
can't write block expression such as if else but can use ternary operator 

has to get a string in the end

Property binding:

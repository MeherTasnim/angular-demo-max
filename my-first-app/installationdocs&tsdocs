to install and create angular:

npm install -g @angular/cli

to create app: 
ng new create-new-app --no-strict 

--no-strict is used 

if asked to add angular routing: choose no

ng cd create-new-app

ng serve - to open app

TypeScript 
- ts has more features than vanilla JS
-compiled into JS and JS is run into the browser, not ts


npm install --save bootstrap

Angular in the end is a JS framework,changing your DOM(html) at runtime!


Components:
root component is AppComponent

reusable, very easy to update

Creating a component:
all components will be added to app.component.html because that's the root component file

each component should have its own folder and name should be same as component

a component is simply a class so that angular can instantiate it


module is used to bundle packages. AppModule is in this case- it's a bundle of functionality of our app. it gives angular info which features does my app have and use, such as using @NgModule decorator

broswermodule gives all base functionality needed to start our app

use selector of components to add to app.component.html

ng generate component component-name
ng g c component-name

component.specs.ts - used for testing

all new components selectors are used in app.component.html since it's the root component html file

for template(html), you don't need array but for 
style or styleUrl-you need an array. Use either style or styleUrl.

So you only have one template(html) but you may have multiple style or style definitions
